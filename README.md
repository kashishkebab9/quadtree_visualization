visualizing my quadtree c++ implementation
I took the implementation of the quadtree I wrote in this repo: https://github.com/kashishkebab9/quadtree_implementation
and I attempted to visualize it using cinder on mac os.

This was the result:

# Installation
In order to install and run, Cinder and Xcode must be installed on your machine.

Cinder: https://libcinder.org/docs/guides/mac-setup/index.html

# Usage

After getting the application to build and run, simple select nodes to be obstacles by clicking with the left mouse button. To select the Start position, shift-click a node. To select the Goal position, ctrl-click a node. 
Happy Planning!
